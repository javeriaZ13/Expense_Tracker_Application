# About Expense_Tracker_Application
This is a simple expense tracking application in Python that utilizes libraries such as tkinter (for GUI) and sq3lite (database connection) etc. The goal for this project was to make a user-friendly app that is easy to use and can help with keeping records of different expenses.

One key feature of this application is its "Monthly Report" option. It lists all the records of the current month and provides a concise summary of expenses, which includes the total expenses of the month, number of transactions done, the highest expense category etc.
